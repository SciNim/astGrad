* astGrad - Symbolic differentiation based on the Nim AST

*NOTE*: This name *really* is not final.... :P

This library performs symbolic differentiation based on the nodes of
the Nim AST. This allows for compile time generation of derivatives to
avoid approximations due to numerical methods.

Note: as this is dealing with symbolic differentiation and the code
isn't extremely smart about doing simplification yet, the resulting
function can become relatively large on higher orders.
For example the 8th derivative of =tanh(x)= produces about ~7000 lines
of code...

For lower orders it works perfectly fine though and as the additional
code generation is exponential in nature, even something like the 5th
order is still reasonable in case of =tanh= (O(70) lines).

Some simple simplification (of same addition / subtraction terms,
multiplication / division) should help a lot.

** Usage

Using this library is pretty straightforward. There is essentially
only a single public macro:
#+begin_src nim
macro derivative(arg, wrt: untyped): untyped
#+end_src

This macro takes a Nim expression and a symbol to differentiate by.

For example:
#+begin_src nim
echo derivative(x * x, x) == 2 * x
echo derivative(x * y, y) == x
echo derivative(exp(x), x) == exp(x)
echo derivative(sin(x) * cos(μ)^2 + exp(-((x - μ)^2) / (2 * σ^2)), μ)
#...
#+end_src
you get the idea.
Of course every symbol used in the expression for which the derivative
is to be computed must exist in the Nim code (otherwise you get
"undeclared identifier" errors after the macro computed your gradient).

In addition there is a helper template:
#+begin_src nim
template ∂(arg, wrt: untyped): untyped
#+end_src
to make the code a bit more pretty. In addition to this template
higher order versions are defined using superscript unicode,
e.g. =∂²=, =∂³= etc.

Feel free to wrap the call in a procedure to generate the full
gradient procedure:
#+begin_src nim
proc gradSin(x: float): float =
  result = ∂(sin(x), x)

doAssert gradSin(-Pi) == cos(-Pi)
doAssert gradSin(0.0) == cos(0.0)
doAssert gradSin(Pi/2.0) == cos(Pi/2.0)
#+end_src

Feel free to go crazy on your derivatives.

Note: the library currently has no introspection functionality to
compute derivatives of user defined functions. For a purely
mathematical procedure it should be rather straight forward. More
complex statements are not really the goal of this library. Its aim is
to provide a convenient way to generate gradients of functions that a)
one is too lazy to write down or b) that might already be a bit
annoying to compute by hand.
