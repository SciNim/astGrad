* astGrad - Symbolic differentiation based on the Nim AST

*NOTE*: This name *really* is not final.... :P

This library performs symbolic differentiation based on the nodes of
the Nim AST. This allows for compile time generation of derivatives to
avoid approximations due to numerical methods.

Note: as this is dealing with symbolic differentiation and the code
isn't extremely smart about doing simplification yet, the resulting
function can become relatively large on higher orders.
For example the 8th derivative of =tanh(x)= produces about ~7000 lines
of code...

For lower orders it works perfectly fine though and as the additional
code generation is exponential in nature, even something like the 5th
order is still reasonable in case of =tanh= (O(70) lines).

Some simple simplification (of same addition / subtraction terms,
multiplication / division) should help a lot.
